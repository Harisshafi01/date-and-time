# date-and-time
this code creates a GUI window that dynamically displays the current time, day of the week, and date using the tkinter library and the time module. The displayed information is updated every second, providing a real-time representation of the current time and date.


# Real-Time Clock GUI

This is a simple Python script that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the current time, day of the week, and date in real-time. The GUI is built using the `tkinter` library and the time-related information is retrieved and formatted using the `time` module.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script directly.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script using the following command:



## Usage

- Upon running the script, a GUI window will open displaying the current time, day of the week, and date.
- The time label is displayed in a large font with a yellow foreground color and a black background.
- The day label is displayed in a large font.
- The date label is displayed in a slightly smaller font.
- The displayed time, day, and date are updated automatically every second.

## Customization

- You can customize the appearance of the labels by modifying the font, foreground color, or background color in the respective `Label` constructor calls.
- Feel free to adjust the formatting of the time and date strings by referring to the `strftime` function documentation in the `time` module.
